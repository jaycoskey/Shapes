## Orbicle

Briefly, this shape resembles a cross between a lace doily and a soccer ball.  Think of a soccer ball as a black 20-sided die (d20) that's been painted white then had its corners chopped off.  Such a shape has 12 pentagons (from the vertices of the d20) and 20 hexagons (from the faces of the d20).  The orbicle has:
* 12 rings around a sphere, centered on the d20 vertices, and
* 20 rings around a sphere, centered on the d20 faces,
* 20 small planar "hexgrids", centered on the d20 faces, each consisting of a small central hexagon surrounded by six others.
